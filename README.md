## Gentleman. React eCommerce Web App. 

It's a test project that was built with React and Redux to improve my programming skills. It's an online Clothing Store for Men. You can:

* Search for clothes with the Searh Bar at the top of the page or by choosing the category (<em>Clothing, Shoes, Accessories</em>). Each category contains subcategories. For example <em>Clothing</em> has such subcategories as <em>Suits, Blazers, Trousers, Shirts, Coats, Polo and T-shirts</em>.

* You can filter all clothes by <em>Color, Size, Season, Material</em> and <em>Price</em>.

* You can add Products to Cart.
