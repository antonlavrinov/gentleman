## Gentleman. React eCommerce Web App. 

It's a test project that was built with React and Redux to improve my programming skills. It's an online Clothing Store for Men. You can:

* Search for clothes with the Searh Bar at the top of the page or by choosing the category (*Clothing*, *Shoes*, *Accessories*). Each category contains subcategories. For example *Clothing* has such subcategories as *Suits*, *Blazers*, *Trousers*, *Shirts*, *Coats*, *Polo* and *T-shirts*.

* You can filter all clothes by *Color*, *Size*, *Season*, *Material* and *Price*.

* You can add Products to Cart.
